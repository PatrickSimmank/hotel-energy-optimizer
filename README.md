# Hotel Energy Benchmarking & Optimization Demo

This demo is part of my application for the **Associate Business Developer** position at **Eliq**, showcasing entrepreneurial thinking and rapid prototyping with open energy data.

## 🚀 Concept

Hotels often consume more energy than necessary, especially during low occupancy periods (e.g. late nights, off-season).  
**What if we could use open energy + weather + occupancy data to nudge hotel operators toward smarter, real-time decisions?**

This tool simulates:
- Hourly energy consumption of a hotel
- Benchmarks against peer properties
- Detects inefficiencies during low occupancy
- Provides actionable insights (and mock automation triggers)

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- Simple behavior or automation changes can yield 5–20% savings in hospitality
- Energy efficiency can be driven by data intelligence, not just tech retrofits
- This prototype reflects how we can turn **real-time data** into **real-world impact**
